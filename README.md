A line editor. A clone of the venerable ed(1).

# why rust

Purely for the aesthetics of the name.

And also something about zero-cost abstractions and memory safety, if you're
into that sort of thing.

# why ed

Ken Thompson wrote the original `ed` for UNIX in 1971, which would inspire
`ex`, `vi`, and most recently `vim`, an editor I use every day.

Ed has been the butt of many [jokes](https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt),
but it remains an important part of UNIX history, being an archetype for many
scriptable tools to come after it.

It's simplicity (in both implementation and usage), combined with its important
role in the history of UNIX, makes it an fun target for a small project.
